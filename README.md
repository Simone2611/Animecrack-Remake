## Warning

All anime options are available with Italian subtitles (sub ITA) or Italian dubbed audio (dub ITA). There is no version available for English-language anime.

I will not do it in English because I typically don't watch anime in that language.

If you comprehend Japanese or Italian, you can utilize this site to watch anime without encountering any advertisements.

If, at some point, it ceases to function, it's likely due to alterations on the website from which I source the anime. I'll update it to as soon as i can.

## Overview

On the first page, you'll find the latest updates on recent anime releases. Use the search bar to explore anime titles, if you can't locate a specific anime, it might be listed under an alternative name or is yet to be released.

## How to use

I will make it easy to use it when i finish it 100% with 0 bug
